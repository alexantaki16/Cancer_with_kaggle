# Cancer_with_kaggle

Welcome!

This repository is the home of the cancer prediction project I have worked on! (Go to the master branch - you are the main right now).

This project uses a Kaggle dataset (it is a structured dataset in the event you are wondering).  Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) if you want to see the data!

I wanted to do more projects since I have a bunch of courses done and it is time to test the waters.  Nothing will teach you the way staring a blank Google Colab will.  It was a great time learning more about Machine Learning and I am going to put this on my personal website soon.  If you have any questions feel free to reach out.

The next project will start soon!

Never Stop Learning!
